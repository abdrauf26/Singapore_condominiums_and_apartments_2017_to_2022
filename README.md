The goal of the project is to carry out an industry-relevant project in applied data science that synthesizes concepts from data analysis and visualization. The project includes the thought process, EDA solving framework, and communication of insights from the dataset. For the project, a private residential property transaction dataset on the Singapore condominiums and apartments (January 2017 and January 2022) has been chosen from the following [URA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/transaction/search.action) website. 

## Problem Statement

In our current times that we are living in, there are many factors involved in relation to the Singapore property and real estate prices.
Over the past 5 years that includes the COVID-19 period between January 2020 to January 2022, it has been an interesting journey of constant changes and adaptability.
The data analysis for this project will include Singapore Condominium & Apartment Prices datasets in Singapore between the period of January 2017 to January 2022. 
It aims to provide clarity in understanding the different property prices and trends from the different districts of Singapore and see its correlations to the different factors such as :

- Unit Price($psf)
- Number of Units
- Price ($)
- Postal District
- Type of sale
- Project Name
- Street Name
- Property Type
- Market Segment
- Floor Level
